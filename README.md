# Bajo Board

The Bajo Board or accelerometer sensor system is an integrated sensor system consisting of accelerometer, inclinometer and seismometer sensors. The accelerometer sensor is used to detect vibrations and carry out seismic imaging. The inclinometer sensor is used to detect tilt from monitoring stations. The seismometer sensor is used to calculate the SI value to detect early if there is an earthquake or tectonic activity and send a warning if an earthquake with MMI level 5 or above is detected.
